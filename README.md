# password-generator
This project will comprise of a simple random password generator that takes in parameters concerning the number and kinds of characters to use before generating

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
The motivation of this project is to learn how to use javascript to accomplish complex tasks that can handle multiple different inputs to produce various outcomes using sound logic

- Why did you build this project? 
I built this project to practice writing functions, conditionals, and loops in javascript, and also to practice with using Math functions for randomness.

- What problem does it solve?
This project solves the problem of generating a random password between 8-128 characters, and it can take user input to change the possible outcomes to include or exclude certain kinds of characters depending on what the user wants.

- What did you learn?
I learned that it is important to use console logging as I write javascript to make sure each step is accomplishing what I am trying to do as I write them, as that has greatly helped in narrowing down and isolating bugs and making the overall process quicker and more efficient. I also honed my skills with using Math.random effectively.  Also, it is important to utilize "return" statements in functions if you want them to end if certain criteria are not met.
